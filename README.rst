ModularMailer-XlsxDriver
========================

Description
-----------
A plugin that allows an Excel \*.xlsx file to be imported into the Modular Mailer application. (For Excel97 \*.xls files, used the XlsDriver plugin)

Installation
------------
Installation instructions will be updated as the Modular Mailer project takes shape. Currently, the plan is to distribute the plugins on PyPI, therefore installation will theoretically be the following::

    pip install ModularMailer-XlsxDriver

Installation requires the ModularMailer project to already be installed.
